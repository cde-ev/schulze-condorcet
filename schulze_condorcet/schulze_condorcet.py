    The Schulze method is described here: http://www.9mail.de/m-schulze/schulze1.pdf.

    One thing to mention is, that we do not do any tie breaking.

    For a nice set of examples see the test suite.

    Note that the candidates should already be sorted meaningful. The return of this
    function is stable under arbitrary sorting of the candidates, but only identical
    if the candidates are passed in the same order. This roots in the fact that the
    result ``1=2>0`` and ``2=1>0`` carry the same meaning but are not identical.
    Therefore, we determine the order of candidates equal to each other in the final
    result by the order of those in the explicitly passed in candidates.

    The return of this function is identical under arbitrary sorting of the votes passed
    in. Moreover, the order of equal candidates in the passed in votes does not matter.

    :param votes: The vote strings on which base we want to determine the overall
      preference. One vote has the form ``3>0>1=2>4``, where the names between the
      relation signs are exactly those passed in with the ``candidates`` parameter.
    :param candidates: We require that the candidates be explicitly passed. This allows
      for more flexibility (like returning a useful result for zero votes).
    :param strength: A function which will be used as the metric on the graph of all
      candidates. See `strength.py` for more detailed information.
