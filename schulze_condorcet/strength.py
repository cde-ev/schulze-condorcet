"""Example implementations to define the strength of a link in the Schulze problem.

We view the candidates as vertices of a graph and determining the result as the
strongest path in the graph. To determine the strength of a path, we have to define a
metric which takes the voting of the voters into account.

Therefore, we transform every vote string into a number of supports and a number of
oppositions per path in the graph of candidates (for details, see at `schulze_evaluate`).
Now, we use this and the total number of votes to define the strength of a given path
in the graph of all candidates.

How to asses the strength of a path is one thing not specified by the Schulze method and
indeed there are several possibilities. We offer some sample implementations of such a
strength function, together with an protocol defining the interface of a generic
strength function . You can use it to implement your own strength function.
